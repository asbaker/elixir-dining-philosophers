Description From [Communicating Sequential Processes](http://usingcsp.com/) by Tony Hoare
-------------
"In ancient times, a wealthy philanthropist endowed a College to accommodate ﬁve eminent philosophers.
Each philosopher had a room in which he could engage in his professional activity of thinking;
there was also a common dining room, furnished with a circular table, surrounded by ﬁve chairs,
each labelled by the name of the philosopher who was to sit in it. The names of the philosophers
were PHIL0, PHIL1, PHIL2, PHIL3, PHIL4, and they were disposed in this order anticlockwise around
the table. To the left of each philosopher there was laid a golden fork, and in the centre stood
a large bowl of spaghetti, which was constantly replenished. A philosopher was expected to spend
most of his time thinking; but when he felt hungry, he went to the dining room, sat down in his
own chair, picked up his own fork on his left, and plunged it into the spaghetti. But such is the
tangled nature of spaghetti that a second fork is required to carry it to the mouth. The philosopher
therefore had also to pick up the fork on his right. When we was ﬁnished he would put down both his
forks, get up from his chair, and continue thinking. Of course, a fork can be used by only on
philosopher at a time. If the other philosopher wants it, he just has to wait until the fork is
available again."
